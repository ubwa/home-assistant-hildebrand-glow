"""
Error handling and recovery strategies for the coordinator.

This module provides utilities for handling errors that occur during
data updates, including retry logic, circuit breaker patterns, and
graceful degradation strategies.

Use cases:
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker to prevent cascading failures
- Error categorization and appropriate responses
- Graceful degradation when partial data is available
