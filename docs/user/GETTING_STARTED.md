This guide will help you install and set up the Integration Blueprint custom integration for Home Assistant.

## Prerequisites

- Home Assistant 2025.7.0 or newer
- HACS (Home Assistant Community Store) installed
- Network connectivity to [external service/device]

## Installation

### Via HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in your Home Assistant instance
2. Go to "Integrations"
3. Click the three dots in the top right corner
4. Select "Custom repositories"
5. Add this repository URL: `https://github.com/jpawlowski/hacs.integration_blueprint`
6. Set category to "Integration"
7. Click "Add"
8. Find "Integration Blueprint" in the integration list
9. Click "Download"
10. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/jpawlowski/hacs.integration_blueprint/releases)
2. Extract the `ha_integration_domain` folder from the archive
3. Copy it to `custom_components/ha_integration_domain/` in your Home Assistant configuration directory
4. Restart Home Assistant

## Initial Setup

After installation, add the integration:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **+ Add Integration**
3. Search for "Integration Blueprint"
4. Follow the configuration steps:

### Step 1: Connection Information

Enter the required connection details:

- **Host/IP Address:** The hostname or IP address of your device/service
- **API Key/Token:** Your authentication credentials (if applicable)
- **Port:** Connection port (default: 8080)

Click **Submit** to test the connection.

### Step 2: Configuration Options

Configure optional settings:

- **Update Interval:** How often to poll for updates (default: 5 minutes)
- **Name:** Friendly name for this integration instance

Click **Submit** to complete setup.

## What Gets Created

After successful setup, the integration creates:

### Devices

- **Device Name:** Main device representing your connected service/hardware
  - Model information
  - Software version
  - Configuration URL (link to device web interface)

### Entities

The following entities are automatically created:

#### Sensors

- `sensor.<device_name>_<sensor_name>` - Descriptive sensor measurements
- More sensors as applicable to your setup

#### Binary Sensors

- `binary_sensor.<device_name>_<sensor_name>` - On/off status indicators

#### Switches

- `switch.<device_name>_<switch_name>` - Controllable on/off switches

#### Other Platforms

Additional entities may be created depending on your device capabilities.

## First Steps

### Dashboard Cards

Add entities to your dashboard:

1. Go to your dashboard
2. Click **Edit Dashboard** → **Add Card**
3. Choose card type (e.g., "Entities", "Glance")
4. Select entities from "Integration Blueprint"

Example entities card:

```yaml
type: entities
title: Integration Blueprint
entities:
  - sensor.device_name_sensor
  - binary_sensor.device_name_connectivity
  - switch.device_name_switch
```

### Automations

Use the integration in automations:

**Example - Trigger on sensor change:**

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "React to sensor value"
    trigger:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: sensor.device_name_sensor
    action:
      - action: notify.notify
        data:
          message: "Sensor changed to {{ trigger.to_state.state }}"
```

**Example - Control switch based on time:**

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Turn on in morning"
    trigger:
      - trigger: time
        at: "07:00:00"
    action:
      - action: switch.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: switch.device_name_switch
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Failed

If setup fails with connection errors:

1. Verify the host/IP address is correct and reachable
2. Check that the API key/token is valid
3. Ensure no firewall is blocking the connection
4. Check Home Assistant logs for detailed error messages

### Entities Not Updating

If entities show "Unavailable" or don't update:

1. Check that the device/service is online
2. Verify API credentials haven't expired
3. Review logs: **Settings** → **System** → **Logs**
4. Try reloading the integration

### Debug Logging

Enable debug logging to troubleshoot issues:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.ha_integration_domain: debug
```

Add this to `configuration.yaml`, restart, and reproduce the issue. Check logs for detailed information.
