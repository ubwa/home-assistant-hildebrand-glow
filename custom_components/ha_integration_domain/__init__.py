"""
Custom integration to integrate ha_integration_domain with Home Assistant.

This integration demonstrates best practices for:
- Config flow setup (user, reconfigure, reauth)
- DataUpdateCoordinator pattern for efficient data fetching
- Multiple platform types (sensor, binary_sensor, switch, select, number)
- Service registration and handling
- Device and entity management
- Proper error handling and recovery

For more details about this integration, please refer to:

    Set up this integration using UI.

    This is called when a config entry is loaded. It:
    1. Creates the API client with credentials from the config entry
    2. Initializes the DataUpdateCoordinator for data fetching
    3. Performs the first data refresh
    4. Sets up all platforms (sensors, switches, etc.)
    5. Registers services
    6. Sets up reload listener for config changes

    Data flow in this integration:
    1. User enters username/password in config flow (config_flow.py)
    2. Credentials stored in entry.data[CONF_USERNAME/CONF_PASSWORD]
    3. API Client initialized with credentials (api/client.py)
    4. Coordinator fetches data using authenticated client (coordinator/base.py)
    5. Entities access data via self.coordinator.data (sensor/, binary_sensor/, etc.)

    This pattern ensures credentials from setup flow are used throughout
    the integration's lifecycle for API communication.
